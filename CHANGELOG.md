## [3.4.0] - 2026-02-24

### 🎨 Added - Shift Filter Context & Clarifications
- **Total Workers Tooltip (All Filter)**: Info icon with tooltip explaining workers may appear in both Day and Night shifts due to overtime work
- **Shift Filter Warning (Day/Night Filter)**: Yellow warning banner explaining that view includes overtime workers from previous shifts
- **Context-aware UI**: Tooltip/warning visibility automatically adjusts based on Working Shift filter selection
- **Performance Context**: Clarifies that performance rates may not reflect actual efficiency when viewing Day/Night only filters

### 🎨 Improved - User Guide Visual Enhancements
- Changed all User Guide section headers to bright blue (text-blue-700) for better visibility
- Improved visual hierarchy and navigation within manual sections

### 🔍 Technical Details
- Added `kpiWorkersInfoIcon` element with Font Awesome info-circle icon
- Added `shiftFilterWarning` element with yellow warning styling
- Modified `updateKPIs()` function to show/hide elements based on `AppState.filters.workingShift`
- Info icon visible only when Working Shift = "All"
- Warning banner visible only when Working Shift = "Day" or "Night"

## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-21

### 🔧 Fixed - Critical Database Issues
- **DB Save/Load Efficiency Fields**: Fixed Worker S/T and Worker Rate(%) not being saved/loaded
  - Added database migration `0002_add_efficiency_fields.sql`
  - Added `worker_st` and `worker_rate_pct` columns to `raw_data` table
  - Backend API now saves/loads efficiency fields correctly
  - Frontend `loadUploadById` now restores all efficiency fields
- **Modal Outlier Filtering**: Fixed Worker Detail modal not reflecting Outlier Threshold
  - Modal now filters out outliers when calculating summary work rate
  - Main page % and modal % now match correctly
- **Hourly Work Distribution Chart**: Fixed chart using incorrect field names
  - Changed from `S_T`, `Rate`, `Work Rate(%)` to `Worker S/T`, `Worker Rate(%)`
  - Chart now displays hourly efficiency correctly

### 🔍 Added - Debug Logging
- Added debug logs for DB load process (rawData restoration)
- Added debug logs for processData efficiency fields tracking
- Added warning logs for Worker S/T=0 or Rate=0 (first 5 records)

### 🗑️ Breaking Changes
- **Existing DB data incompatible**: Data saved before v3.1.0 has worker_st=0, worker_rate_pct=0
- **Action required**: Delete old uploads and re-upload Excel files
- **Migration**: Run `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply mes-r018-analysis-production --local`

### 📝 Changed
- Updated cache-busting version to v=1771690200
- Cleaned local database (deleted all existing uploads for testing)

## [3.0.2] - 2026-02-21

### ✨ Fixed - Critical Outlier Filtering
- **Root Cause**: `aggregateByWorkerOnly()` was re-processing raw data, bypassing outlier filter
- **Solution**: Modified to use already-filtered `workerAgg` data only
- **Result**: Outliers removed in `aggregateByWorker()` no longer reappear in charts/bands
- **Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary data re-processing, reduced memory usage

### 📊 Improved - Data Consistency
- Ensured consistency across entire pipeline: `updateReport()` → `aggregateByWorker()` → `aggregateByWorkerOnly()`
- All components (KPIs, Performance Bands, Charts) now use same filtered data
- Filter order: UI filters → Rework exclusion → S/T > 0 validation → Outlier removal

## [3.0.1] - 2026-02-21

### 🔧 Fixed - Outlier Threshold Mode Separation
- **Work Efficiency Mode**: Outlier Threshold UI shown, filtering active
- **Time Utilization Mode**: Outlier Threshold UI hidden, filtering inactive
- Applied outlier filtering only at W/O level (removed from Worker Total level)
- Improved logging with filtering statistics

### 🗄️ Enhanced - D1 Database Error Handling
- Added graceful fallback for local dev without D1 binding
- Strengthened error handling for `/api/uploads` endpoint

### ✅ Verified - Working Day/Shift Calculation
- Day shift: 06:00-17:59 (same date)
- Night shift: 18:00-05:59 (00:00-05:59 belongs to previous day)
- actualShift correctly mapped from ShiftCalendar

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-20

### 🎊 Added - Dual Metric System
- **Time Utilization Rate**: Actual work time / Available shift time × 100%
- **Work Efficiency Rate**: Assigned standard time / Actual work time × 100%
- Real-time metric toggle with icons (clock ⇄ lightning)

### 🎨 Changed - Metric-Specific UI/UX
- Time Utilization: Blue theme, time in minutes
- Work Efficiency: Purple theme, efficiency in percentage
- Redesigned Performance Bands: Excellent (≥15%/120%), Good, Normal, Poor, Critical

### 🔍 Enhanced - Data Filtering
- Automatic Rework exclusion (W column = true)
- Worker S/T > 0 condition for Work Efficiency mode
- Worker Rate(%) 0% handling (not missing)

### 👤 Improved - Worker Detail Modal
- Time Utilization: Daily/hourly work time charts, overlap removal display
- Work Efficiency: Daily/hourly efficiency charts, S/T·Rate·Assigned·Efficiency display

### 🐛 Fixed
- Overlap removal applied per worker (not merged across workers)
- Performance Band empty ranges removed
- Worker Rate(%) missing handled as 0%

### 💔 Breaking Changes
- Removed previous Valid-only work rate calculation

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-18
